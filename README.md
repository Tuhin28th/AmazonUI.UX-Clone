About This Project
This is a UI/UX clone of the Amazon website created as a mini-project to replicate the visual design and layout of the original site. The project focuses on the front-end implementation using HTML and CSS, recreating key sections such as the navigation bar, hero section, and shopping sections. While the project does not include any backend or dynamic functionality, it provides an interactive, responsive design that mimics the Amazon user experience.

Features:
Responsive Design: Optimized for different screen sizes using CSS.
Navigation Bar: Includes a logo, search bar, and cart functionality placeholder.
Hero Section: Displays a static or sliding banner, replicating the Amazon homepage.
Shop Section: Styled to showcase featured products in a grid layout.
Manual Image Slider: Allows users to manually switch between hero images without JavaScript automation.
Technologies Used:
HTML5 for structuring the content.
CSS3 for styling and layout, including flexbox for responsive design.
FontAwesome for icons in the navigation bar.
