About This Project<br>
This is a UI/UX clone of the Amazon website created as a mini-project to replicate the visual design and layout of the original site. The project focuses on the front-end implementation using HTML and CSS, recreating key sections such as the navigation bar, hero section, and shopping sections. While the project does not include any backend or dynamic functionality, it provides an interactive, responsive design that mimics the Amazon user experience.
